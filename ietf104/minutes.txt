  - API (update)                   10  Tommy&Darshak
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-capport-api-02

tommy's presentation: https://github.com/capport-wg/wg-materials/blob/master/ietf104/api.pdf

mt: you have about 8 open issues on github, but some are complete
tommy: I will do a pass on that.
[we do a pass in real time]
20 can be closed but a new issue can be opened
19 is done
..[crosstalk] several others done. about 4 are meaningfully open.

discuss 18 - bytes remaining
tommy: if we have insight into what capport does for blocking, do they have data limits or generally at which layer are they doing it. if we are unsure should we make that part of the name.
erik: it must be something the device itself can count (as opposed to opaque tunnel overhead)
chris seal: operators also apply counters in the case of prepaid. though control plane would not count in that case. tunnels and mobile signaling don't qualify. l3 matches
erik: do bytes sent to the portal explicitly count?
tommy: things that are whitelisted in the capport network don't count
erik: client doesn't know what those things
tommy: beyond the capport itself yes
jean-jacques?: this isn't that useful in UI
tommy: do l3 bytes and comment about whitelisted
mt: ingress or egress?
all: yes (both)
erik kinnear: its better to overcount. whitelisted doesn't matter much
tero: l3 makes sense
mt: rough conensus on tommy's approach

discuss 20
tommy: better served by author making a PR


What does "done" look like for this group?  Chairs
mt: hope near wglc on api draft. architecture draft has a number of open issues (5) as well inclding doh. (#25)

presentation about 'sticking point' https://github.com/capport-wg/wg-materials/blob/master/ietf104/chairs.pdf

mt: is wg comfortable with the boolean cap/nocap signal we've been doing so far rather than a richer state. does anyone have interest? we have json as an escape valve or do we need to block work on these questions.

(no badge): I am more comfortable with binary yes/no. lack use cases and may not be appropriate for capport to do the signal
mt: the webpage also allows a lot of non-machine readable expression
tommy: I agree with the simple view. we don't define the keys as the extension mechanism - we might onsider that
mt: we need an iana registry if extension is desirable. an issue will be filed

mt: chairs need a sense about should we just go forward with the issue list, or do we go back and more full engage with more state about the terms of confinement?

hum question: should we proceed with the simple signal we currently have
<strong>

hum question: should we continue to engage with finding a solution to the richer state space
<silence>

mt: clear hum - will send it to the list. necessary changes are expected by ietf 105.
